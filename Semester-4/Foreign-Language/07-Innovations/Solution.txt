	In my opinion, Smart Dust should enter for the award because considering the potential value to humanity,
	it has the most capability to become a solution for the most vital problems of humanity such as climate change, earthquakes and storms.
	It should be also noted that Smart Dust doesn't apply to just one area to be used but it can be used it various areas such as military
	and traffic control which means that although the number of potential applications are the same with others, the areas are more diverse. 
	Eventhough it is harder to reach to the full effect of Smart Dust, once it is applied it will make bigger changes in the world.
