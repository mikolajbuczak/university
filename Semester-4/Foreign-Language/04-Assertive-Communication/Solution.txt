Two theories:
	1. The malfunction of pitot tubes.
	2. Poor communication in cockpit.
Evidence:
	1. Weather data and flight data show that the plane entered a high-altitude thunderstorm.
	2. Radio transmission in which they hear a second voice warning about the speed withat the answer.
Future changes:
	1. Pitot tubes should be inspected and replaced if needed.
	2. The airline should train the flight crew on how to communicate effectively.
Attachment contains:
	Transcript of all the radio communication and a brief explanation of how pitot tubes work.

2. The airline wouldn't have been allowed to operate unsafe aircraft, if the regulatory had taken its safety responsibilities more seriously.
3. If the manufacturer had responded to previous pressurisation incidents in the same type of aircraft, the malfunction wouldn't have occured.
4. The plane would have crashed much sooner, if it hadn't been in autopilot mode.
5. If the crew had shared a common language, they would have been able to communicate better with each other and with the maintenance department.
6. If they hadn't found the FDR, the causes of the accident would have been less clear.
